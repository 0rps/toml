There is a toml-test.py script which acts as a harness in order to allow toml to be used with [BurntSushi's toml test suite](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test), written in Go. Usage means installing go, the toml-test suite and running the toml-test go binary with toml-test.py as its argument. Modification of tests should happen in BurntSushi's repository.
